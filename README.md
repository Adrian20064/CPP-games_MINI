An Scientific calculator with multiplication, addition, substraction, division, exponent, square root.
Run on the Terminal and its infinite until you press "7" which is the exit buttom.

But its running okay.

A tic tac toe console game using classes on CPP and the players
has the name and symbol X and O.

When is the time to choose your spot is with the pattern:

```
  0 1 2  <- Columns
0 . . .
1 . . .
2 . . .
^
| Rows
```

Explanation: the indexes in progamming are counted as [0,1,2,...]
In this case the row or columnn: [0 = 0(index) | 1 = 1(index) | 2 = 2(index)]
So, this is as coordinates x and y, for example:

```
Player X Choose row 0 and columnn 1

  0 1 2
0 . X .
1 . . .
2 . . .

```

Run it:

- g++ Tic_tac_toe.cpp -o (the name wiht .exe)
- ./(the name wiht .exe)
